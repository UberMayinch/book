## Why Philosophy?

Philosophy = Philo + Sophia = love of truth. 

Fact: Pursuing the truth is not always aligned with evolutionary incentives ([[Psychology 101]]).

The question lends itself to endless debate because any justification to engage is almost necessarily **recursive** and **epistemically circular.** 

Notice that the only way to answer this question is to refer to some internal intuition. This is an example of a question approaching which requires **meta-cognition**, or reflecting on one's own thought. 

These questions have a tendency to get trapped in linguistic games and breakdown our system of language and thought in a similar way to how Godel's Incompleteness Theorem breaks logical systems through self-reference.


There is a spectrum of beliefs from people who believe that it is your divine duty to seek truth to those who doubt the existence of truth altogether.

Though these arguments seem to be the most abstracted away from any real life application, the bad quality of a substantial proportion of the conversations can be attributed to people never having paid any attention to their thoughts in this domain.
