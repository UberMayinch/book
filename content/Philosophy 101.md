## Why Philosophy?
---
Philosophy = Philo + Sophia = love of truth. 

**Fact:** Pursuing the truth is not always aligned with evolutionary incentives ([[Psychology 101]]).

That which makes you seek truth without compromise is the essence of philosophy.

Why should one do philosophy?

The question lends itself to endless debate because any justification to engage is almost necessarily **recursive** and **epistemically circular.** (i.e. a belief that needs to be defined in terms of other beliefs which are assumed to be true). 

**Axiom:** Eliminating suffering is **good**.

I prefer to pursue truth because from my perspective it seems to be the shortest way of eliminating suffering in any aspect of life. 

It is not my duty to convince you to pursue truth because:
1. The above claim or axiom may not correspond to your personal lived experience. 
2. If you are swayed by my opinion into pursuing the truth, it is highly likely that someone else who is better at persuasion than me can persuade you otherwise. 

## Metaphysics
---
Do you believe in god?
What are the limits of the powers of such a god? Is it a moral agent?
Is the world essentially material or physical?
Do human beings have a soul?
Is there underlying order to the world?
Is history cyclical or linear?

Though these arguments seem to be the most abstracted away from any real life application, the bad quality of a substantial proportion of the conversations can be attributed to people never having paid any attention to their thoughts in this domain. 


## Applied Metaphysics: Spirituality
---
**Fact:** There have been many different religions across the world with wildly varying teachings. 

**Fact:** Adherence to religions is linked with positive mental health outcomes.

**Fact:** A substantial proportion of strong civilizations in the past have been built around a core of strong metaphysical grounding through prayers, rituals etc. Most periods of great creativity have also been linked with religious awakenings of some sort. 

**Fact:** People are willing to fight and kill over these religions.


### Materialist Critical Analysis
1. There is no essential truth underlying religion. Humans project the truth onto it. 
2. There is no truth to be understood, It is all about power. 
3. Society is structured to allow people avenues to delude themselves. This is what religion provides us with. 

### Monotheism
1. There is an essential truth to my religion that is nourishing to human existence. 
2. This essential knowledge has been correctly understood totally in my religion. 
3. All other religions claiming to have understood this are wrong. 

### Pantheism
1. There is a certain essential truth underlying all these religions, that is nourishing to human existence in some way. 
2. We have not fully understood this truth yet. For if it had been grasped in its entirety in any one religion or philosophy it would not be evolving w
3. Religion is the specific cultural garments specific of a spatiotemporal landscape that attempt to impart that kernel of essential metaphysical knowledge. 



The language and metaphors you use 
This essential knowledge is experiential.
