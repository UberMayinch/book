The framework that makes most psychological observations fall into place is the following:
> Human brains are evolved to survive, not thrive. 

All behavior is in essence an adaptation to minimize the effort expended for surviving in perceived circumstances. 

## Cognitive Heuristics

## Social Groups and Peer Pressure
Thinking through unique positions is difficult. 
It also creates conflict if different people have opposing views. 
Therefore, there is a great incentive for people (and you) to adopt the positions espoused by your peer group instead of thinking through it yourself. 
Which is why we need to be incredibly wary of anything masquerading as 'common sense'. 
Remember, common sense makes most people live mediocre, unfulfilling and miserable lives. 
If your process is similar to others (i.e. taking things for granted), so are the outcomes.

People only see what they can get from you and that's okay

Most people are lonely and miserable. If you take away your own relationships which you are coping with then you probably are too. 

*Bhakti* and its applications to Business




People package their own unmet desires as **prescriptions**. A "How-To" on life, or any part of it. 

They spend their whole lives trying to conform to societal, religious, familial or other prescriptions for life, suffering in the process. 

When they get nowhere with these, instead of calling them out for the scams they are, people play along and pass them on to the next generation to get the sort of neurotic enjoyment they have been conditioned into by these very same prescriptions. 

There is no "should" for any action. There is only cause and effect.
