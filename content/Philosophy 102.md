## Epistemology
---

What according to you is truth?
What separates it from belief?
Do we have any knowledge at all?
Does absolute knowledge exist?

In epistemology again, there is a distinction between meta epistemology i.e. a debate about different philosophical positions and applied epistemology which is how we evaluate the truth values of claims in practical contexts. 


### Applied Epistemology
Applied epistemology is a problem we have a pretty good heuristic solution for; The scientific method and Bayes Rule. These are incredibly powerful starting points that have surprisingly large applicability

> **Bayes Rule:**
> $$p(a | b) = \frac{p(b|a)\times p(a)}{p(b)}$$
> $p(a | b) = posterior$
> $p(a) = prior$
> $p(b)=marginal$
> $p(b | a) = likelihood$

This is a heuristic for belief updation.
Prior probability multiplied by odds after experiment gives posterior odds. 


> **Scientific Method** 
>  Ignoramus + Falsifiability. 
> Ignoramus = We don't know anything.
> Falsifiability = Claims for which we can construct an experiment to check the validity of. 

Falsifiable claims are powerful because of their predictive power. 
Ignoramus urges you towards epistemic humility.
