There can be two kinds of disagreements between you and an interlocutor. 
1. The objective facts of a certain situation. 
2. The philosophical groundings for your positions. 

The distinction is not ultimately rigid because what you determine as an "objective fact" also depends on your method of arriving at truth i.e. your "epistemological framework". 

Constructing an Argument/Judgement:
---
1. Understand the claim.
2. Lay out your presuppositions/axioms.
3. Work backwards and forwards from your axioms and the claim to fill the gap with the necessary domain specific knowledge in a **Syllogistic Chain**. It is necessary to account for **cognitive biases** and **logical fallacies** at each step in the chain.
